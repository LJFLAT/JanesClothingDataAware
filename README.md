This project is to learn the basics of GitHub access and utilising VisualStudio2019 IDE.

The MainMenu and immediate Sub Menu items (Customers and Products) now open and close without issues.

The project has a couple of issues at present. These are: -
 - Filling the ListViews for Customer and Product screens.
 - Interacting with the related database on the CustomerAdd and ProductAdd screens.
   - When entering information, these screens lock on closing.
